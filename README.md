## Intent

Old-Time-XI is an attempt to make a frozen-in-time copy of Darkstar, with branches for specific use cases.

The first initiative is to retool it for SEs updated stock client without updates, allowing a server+client to just work out of the box".

There are currently no plans to BE a competing project, though anyone can use the code for anything within the bounds of the GPL.

Old-Time-XI is not affiliated with any other groups making open source projects for FFXI.
